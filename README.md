# Java-Keyword-Countdown
@author Fernando Sequineli

This program is similar to the tv show countdown.
There are two players and they can only enter Java keywords.
The player chooses how many rounds he wants to play, in each turn the player chooses how many vowels and consonants  
between 9 letters and both need to form a word, the one who assembles the largest word wins the turn.
